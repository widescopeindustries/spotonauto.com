Hey IH!

I built SpotOnAuto - an AI-powered tool that generates step-by-step car repair guides for any vehicle.

**The problem:** Mechanic labor is $100-150/hour. Simple jobs that take 30 minutes cost $200+ at shops.

**The solution:** Tell the AI your car (year/make/model) and what needs fixing. Get instant DIY instructions.

**Features:**
- AI Repair Guide Generator (40+ repairs)
- AI Diagnostic Chat (troubleshoot by symptoms)
- Utility tools (belt diagrams, part specs)

**Business model:** Free to use, monetized via Amazon affiliate links when users buy parts.

**Stack:** Next.js, Gemini 2.0, Vercel

Would love feedback! What repairs would you want guides for?

I built this because I was tired of paying mechanics $400 for brake jobs I could do in 30 minutes.

The AI generates step-by-step repair instructions customized for your exact vehicle (year, make, model). It's like having a mechanic walk you through the job.

Features:
- Repair guide generator for 40+ common tasks
- Diagnostic chat (describe symptoms or enter OBD codes)
- Parts lists with shopping links

Free to use. Built with Next.js + Gemini 2.0.

Would love feedback on what repairs to support next!
