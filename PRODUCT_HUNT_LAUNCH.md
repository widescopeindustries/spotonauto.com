## 📖 DESCRIPTION (For the full listing)

### The Problem
Car repairs cost $100-150/hour at shops. Simple jobs like changing brake pads, 
replacing a headlight bulb, or swapping a thermostat can cost $200-500 in labor 
alone - even though they take 30 minutes and require basic tools.

### The Solution
SpotOnAuto is an AI-powered repair guide generator. Tell it your vehicle 
(year, make, model) and what you need to fix. In seconds, you get:

✅ Step-by-step instructions written for your exact car
✅ Tool list with what you'll need
✅ Parts list with direct shopping links
✅ Time estimates and difficulty ratings
✅ Safety warnings and pro tips

### Who It's For
- DIY car enthusiasts
- Anyone tired of overpaying for simple repairs
- People who want to learn how their car works
- Budget-conscious vehicle owners

### Key Features
🔧 **AI Repair Guides** - Custom instructions for 40+ common repairs
🔍 **Diagnostic Chat** - Describe symptoms, get AI diagnosis
📊 **Spec Lookup Tools** - Belt diagrams, battery locations, torque specs
🛒 **Parts Integration** - Direct links to buy what you need

### Why It's Different
Unlike YouTube videos that may not match your exact car, or forums with 
conflicting advice, SpotOnAuto generates guides specifically for YOUR vehicle. 
The AI knows the differences between model years and engine variants.

## 💬 MAKER COMMENT (First comment on your listing)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built SpotOnAuto because I was tired of:
1. Paying $400 for a 20-minute brake job
2. Watching 10 YouTube videos that weren't for my exact car
3. Getting conflicting advice on forums

The AI generates repair guides specifically for YOUR vehicle - it knows that a 
2012 Camry is different from a 2015 Camry, and gives you the right instructions.

It's 100% free. I monetize through affiliate links when you buy parts, so you 
get free guides and I get a small commission if you shop through the links.

Would love to hear:
- What repairs you'd want guides for
- Any vehicles you'd like to see better supported
- Features that would make this more useful

Thanks for checking it out! 🚗🔧
