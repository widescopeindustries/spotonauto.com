## 📊 Campaign Setup (Google Ads)

### 1. Campaign Goal
Select **"Website Traffic"** or **"Leads"**. Do not select "Brand Awareness".

### 2. Campaign Type
**Video** -> **Drive Conversions** (if tracking signups/clicks) or **Custom Video Campaign**.

### 3. Bidding Strategy
- **Maximize Conversions** (if conversion tracking is set up)
- **Target CPA** (Cost Per Acquisition) - aim for <$1.00 per click initially.
- **Maximize CPV** (Cost Per View) - good for awareness, aim for $0.05-$0.10.

- "car repair estimate"
- "check engine light meaning"
- Specific vehicle terms: "Honda Accord starter replacement", "BMW X3 headlight"

### B. Placement Targeting (Competitor Channels)
Place your ad *specifically* on these YouTube channels:
- **ChrisFix** (10M+ subs, DIY mechanics)
- **Scotty Kilmer** (4M+ subs)
- **1A Auto** (Detailed repair guides)
- **Car Car** (General auto interest)
- **Engineering Explained**

## 📐 Ad Formats

### 1. Skippable In-Stream Ads (The "Pre-Roll")
- Plays before other videos.
- User can skip after 5 seconds.
- **Strategy:** Make the first 5 seconds count! "Stop paying mechanics $400!"
- **Call-to-Action:** "Get Free Guide" overlay button.

### 2. In-Feed Video Ads (Discovery)
- Appears in YouTube search results and "Watch Next".
- **Strategy:** Use a thumbnail with big text like "Free AI Mechanic vs $150/hr Shop".
- **Headline:** "Fix Any Car Yourself (Free AI Guide)"

### Phase 3: Scaling ($50+/day)
